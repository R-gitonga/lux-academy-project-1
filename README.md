# measuring IGTV perfomance metrics over time

this is a simple project I implemented as part of LUX Acadamey on going data science boot camp.

the project question was " Project - let’s say you’re a Product Data Scientist at Instagram. How would you measure the success of the Instagram TV product?"
To answer the question we began by collecting some data about the performance of IGTV app such as views, likes, and comments for popular videos over time 
and used mariaDB to store our findings.

I then used python programming language to to visualize our data. I relied on pandas for data analysis and used matplotlib to visualize our findings.

from this simple experiment there are a few insights we could draw such as:
video performance trends -  By visualizing the data, we can observe trends in video performance metrics (views, likes, comments) over time. 
For example, we can see if there are any spikes in engagement on specific dates.

User Engagement: We can identify which videos received the highest engagement in terms of likes and comments. This can help us understand what type of content resonates most with the audience.

Popular Titles: Analyzing the data, we can determine which video titles attract more views and engagement. This insight can guide content creators in crafting compelling video titles.

User Contribution: We can analyze which users (identified by user_id) are consistently uploading content and how their videos perform compared to others. This can help in recognizing top contributors.
